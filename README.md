# Dijkstra-Visualization-Application
This project is a C++ application that visualizes how Dijkstra's Algorithm, the father of pathfinding algorithms, works. The application allows users to interactively choose a starting point, an ending point, and place obstacles on a grid. The algorithm then calculates and displays the shortest possible path along with the distance, demonstrating Dijkstra's guaranteed shortest path solution.

# Features
**Interactive Visualization:** Users can select start and end points, as well as place obstacles.<br>
**Shortest Path Calculation:** The application calculates and displays the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.<br>
**Distance Display:** Along with the shortest path, the application shows the total distance traveled.<br>
**Classic Graphics:** Built using C++'s old-school graphics library for a visual representation of the algorithm.<br>
# Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** C++<br>
**Graphics Library:** C++'s graphics.h<br>
# How It Works
**Start Point Selection:** Choose a starting point on the grid where the algorithm will begin.<br>
**End Point Selection:** Select the target destination for the shortest path calculation.<br>
**Obstacle Placement:** Add obstacles on the grid to block certain paths.<br>
**Shortest Path Visualization:** Once the points and obstacles are set, the application computes and visually displays the shortest path along with the total distance
